# ShiftMemo


## Notes
This is the final project for the swift course at e-conomic. Its aim is
to show the knowledge about ios sdk acquired during the course.

## Description
The idea of the project is to create an app that uses the localization
to automatically register the time interval being in a given location.
A practical example can be: the location is your workplace and the app
automatically register your work shifts. Finally it's possible to 
generate reports.

There are similar apps on the store but none of them are automatic, you
need to remember to start the timer and stop it manually, that is not
really practical. It's like logging the times in a notepad. With
ShiftMemo you can forget about registering your times and the app will
make it for you.

# ShifTrack


## Notes
This is the final project for the swift course at e-conomic. Its aim is
to show the knowledge about iOS SDK acquired during the course.

## Description
The idea of the project is to create an app that uses location services
to automatically register the time interval being in a given location.
A practical example can be: the location is your workplace and the app
automatically register your work shifts. Finally it's possible to 
generate reports.

There are similar apps on the store but as a user you
need to remember to start the timer and stop it manually, that is not
really practical. It's like logging the times in a notepad. With
ShifTrack you can forget about registering your times and the app will
do it for you.
